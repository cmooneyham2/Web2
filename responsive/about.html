<h3>Fun Facts and Screenshots</h3>
<p>Heres some fun facts about Dart Frogs.First of all they get their name because their body is shaped like a tiny dart.Their posion comes from their deit so frogs in zooz are less toxic since the zoo controls what they eat,in a zoo these frogs can live up too 15 years. Another fact, instead of females taking care of the eggs the males do and once they are tadpoles the frogs brings them to the water.</p>

        <h3>Baby Dart Frogs</h3>
       <p>After the female frogs lay the eggs the males are actually the ones who take care of the eggs. They protect the eggs until they turn into tadepoles. Once they are tadepoles the male frogs will carry the tadepoles to a new body of water.</p>
