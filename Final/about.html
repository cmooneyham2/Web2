        <h3>What Tents Should I Buy? </h3>
        <p>There are millions of tents to choose from. So, how do you know which one to buy? Well, it all depends on two things. How many people are going to be sleeping in the tent. And what weather are you likely to experince while camping. For Rainy weather it is highly recomended is Dome tents. These tents are shapped like a dome so water can easily roll off of it. Also, they are made with waterproof material. Also if you are in windy weather dome tents are also a good tent to look into. They tend to be more wind- resistant than tall body tents. </p>
