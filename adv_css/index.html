<p>Dart frogs are one of the most poisonus animals in the world. They live in Central America in the tropical rain forest.They grow to be about 1 inch and can live to 3-15 years.They are carnivores so they only eat small bugs. Their deit is why they are so poisonus. So frogs in a zoo are less toxic since their diet is controlled.</p>
